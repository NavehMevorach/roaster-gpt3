AI: A black man walks up the front desk at an exclusive golf course.

“Hi,” he says, “may I register?”

The old white man behind the desk looks at the man and says.

“I'm terribly sorry sir. But this is a members only club. There is a municipal course just 10 minutes down road.”

Upset, the man says to the clerk,

“Yes, I know, I would like to register here please.”

The clerk pauses for a second then repeats “I'm afraid you'll need to go to the municipal course. It's 10 minutes down the road.”

The man, clearly annoyed, spits, “Excuse me. But I am Linford Christie. I won a gold medal at the Olympics.”

“Oh I'm terribly sorry Mr. Christie,” says the clerk.

“In that case, it's fucking 5 minutes down the road!”
